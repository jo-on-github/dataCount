# dataCount
A simple tool to help me log how many pieces of data I have processed during my working day

I am currently working a temp job, updating data on a noSQL database for an educational institution.
The noSQL database is a prepackaged software product, and has no ability to count how many pieces of data I have updated.

I have been asked to keep track of how many records I have updated each day. 
I thought why not make it fun and build a simple counter tool using vanilla JavaScript to refresh my memory and keep the skills up!

This side project will be a fun page to add to and build on as the days go by!
